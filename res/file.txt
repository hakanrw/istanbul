Welcome to Istanbul!

This is a template for Cosmopolitan Libc projects, the Makefile includes the 
necessary  targets to build resource files and source code into a single APE 
executable.

Files that are put into the `res` folder will be embedded in the output
executable. You can access embedded files like any normal file, please
check src/main.c for an example.

You can simply build the project with `make`. 
You can run the project with `make run`.
